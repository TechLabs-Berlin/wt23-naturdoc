# UX-Process 
We started the process by defining the Problem and the Solution of the Product: The problem: How to find the right natural remedies for an ailment? Solution: Create a website that can match the usersâ€™ symptoms/disease to the right medication/treatment. It helped us to visit different websites with similar project aims as ours. But we also looked at cooking websites to get inspiration on how we could display the remedies. 

We had a couple discussions about the possible project scope in the Naturedoc team to build a common idea of the final product. Based on user stories, we decided on MVPs and stretch goals. 

We thought about our users and their needs. Additionally, we conducted a short survey. Since we did not have a lot of time to wait for the results of the survey, the participants are mostly acquaintances of ours and therefore very similar in their live situation, place of residence and opinions. 


## Our Challenges 
- Building an easy user flow 
- Making the available dataset user friendly and easy to use. 
- Meeting the risk of people not going to the doctors though being seriously sick 

# Summary 
All in all we are happy with the results. We managed our time well and worked well together as a team.
